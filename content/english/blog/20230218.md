Round 3 and another chance to take on women's field at The Bog Trials. On the journey down I could see it was going to be a wet race.  On the pre-ride there was a stiff headwind down one of the straights and there was a chill in the air...definitely a day for bib tights.  I went with overshoes to keep my feet dry (or at least a little less wet).

<img src="/images/blog/IMG_3965.jpeg" class="float-start rounded m-2 w-25">The race started and I could feel the muck spitting up from underneath me.  It was mucky but not cyclocross mucky though there was enough that I could just about see through my glasses.  The race settled into a nice pace and Liz and I swapped places on the front for the first couple of laps.  I got a chance to open a small gap and continued to work to widen the gap as the race went on.  Super day of racing and a lot of fun.

I definitely earned my post race hot chocolate and donut.

Time for home and I was glad to have remembered to bring a spare change of clothes (but changing in the car under a blanket requires a lot of wriggling ðŸ˜£).
