The weekend started with the long drive from Dublin to Kanturk.  The weather on the drive down suggested it was going to be a warm weekend ðŸŒž. The day before the race we drove the stage one and two route so that we would have more time on race day. We discussed race tactics and how I might animate the race the following day with the focus on what I could learn rather than the result.  After a tiring day of travelling it was time to unload the car. We took all of our things into the hotel, brought our suitcases and my bike up to the room before we finally had time to relax. I had my pre-race dinner and hit the room early for a refreshing sleep.

I woke up early and when I opened the curtains I was delighted to see that the sun was out.  After grabbing a take away breakfast and loading the car, we went to race HQ for sign on. I was looking forward to stage 1 because I thought the parcours would suit me.  After my usual pre-race warm up I tried to time getting to the pen so that I was still warmed up but was able to get a good start position. The u16 race started ahead of us, followed by the u12 race and then it was go time.

As there was no separate race for the girls, we had a big bunch of riders all vying for position.  Moving around the bunch was tricky and as I moved up for the first climb I bumped a few elbows.  I wanted to attack the first climb to see if I could force a split.  I went to the front and put in a hard effort which was then taken up by some of the boys.  Going over the top there was a large split in the bunch and I was the only girl who'd survived the first effort of the stage.  We then had a fast technical descent on which I could feel the wind blowing through my hair. Over the next section there was a lot of traffic on the road which helped some of the dropped riders make their way back to the lead bunch. The last few kilometres were through a town and it looked like the bunch I was in was going to the line. The pace went up on the final climb and it ended in a super fast bunch sprint to the line.  I finished the stage 7th overall and just pipped Izzy for 1st girl. I was exhausted but got on the rollers for a cool down before the usual roll out check.  Between stage 1 and 2 I made my way back to the hotel, got some quality carbs into me and grabbed as much sleep as I could.

Stage two was a time trial and one of my favourites. Pre-race routine completed I made my way to the start line. Two of the riders in front of me did not make the start so I had no bunnies to chase. It was a ~7km TT which is my first of the longer u14 distances so I was determined to stay focussed. I was happy with my effort but did leave a bit on the course though I can't complain about 6th overall and first girl. Post race there was some slight drizzle which was welcome as I cooled down on the rollers. After the stage, we drove the stage 3 route before going back to the hotel and relaxing over dinner.  The efforts of the day then had me fall straight to sleep (with my treasured bike beside me).

Day 2 (and stage 3) was a much more relaxed affair due to the later start time. I was able to take my time over breakfast and enjoy the drive to Race HQ. On the way over the sun was shining through the car window although by the time I started warming up it was pouring rain (parent promptly called over with an umbrella).  By race call up the rain had cleared, the sun was out and it was starting to warm up. We were neutralised until we got around the first corner after which the pace immediately picked up. The boys clearly had a race plan as there were a lot of attacks from the gun.  On a slight drag, I tried to get off the front but was quickly closed down.  In hindsight the drag was not steep enough.  But thats how the race continued until the approach to the finish.  In the last kilometre there was vying for position with everyone trying to move up. The finish was a short punchy climb and we attacked hard. The race blew apart and as it did one of the riders deviated from his line edging me in toward the kerb on the side of the road forcing me to tap the brakes.  I recovered for 7th overall and 2nd girl behind Izzy (super finish Izzy!).  Race finished and I cooled down (in more ways than one).

Now it was time to chill with the girls, grab an ice-cream before heading to the presentations.  I already knew the stage and overall results but was delighted to learn that the u14 [Orwell Wheelers](https://orwellwheelers.org) girls team took the overall u14 team prize.  This was only possible thanks to [Carlow Road Cycling Club](https://www.facebook.com/CarlowRoadCyclingClub/) who had allowed Naoise Byrne to guest ride for us to make up the minimum team size.

Great weekend and great racing capped off with a recovery swim at the hotel.
