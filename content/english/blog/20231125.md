It is such a treat to be able to practice and race on a UCI World Cup course as a u14 rider.  Similar to last year, the day before the main event there would be support races for the u14, u16 youths as well as junior, senior, masters and women riders.  The course had everything from long fast straights, twisty technical sections, barriers, a long sand section, steep climbs and tricky descents.  Around the course was the impressive start / finish gantry, a number of fan zones, large LED screens and an impressive podium.

The 13 riders in the u14 category had a good entry with all the regular competitors keen to test themselves against the tough course.

The start was on the road which meant that it would be fast with a tricky right turn at the end of the straight.  The right turn took us up over a path and the rise was covered by sandbags which could have cause some falls.  I was second wheel around the first corner and set about racing from the front and keeping the pace high.  The first section of the course had a lot of flat straights which was all about getting the power down.  First lap into the sand and there was a lot of riders from the race ahead so I couldn't even try to ride it.  I pushed the bike but looking back shouldering would have been the better option.  Despite that mistake I had a good gap coming out of the sand but wanted to push on and test myself against the course.

The course has a 'stadium section' which is like a big bowl with steep banks and tricky descents to test the riders.  This section was the most fun but also the hardest.  It was not yet as muddy as it would get later in the weekend but there was plenty to test the riders in the support race.  After the stadium there was a long section starting with some mud then light grass back toward the start finish straight.  The start finish gantry was amazing to ride through on race day with parents and supporters either side.

Thereafter, the race was fairly uneventful for me.  I would occasionally pass riders from the races ahead but on the wide open section past the pits I could see that I was maintaining / opening a comfortable gap in my own race.  Delighted with the day and taking the win in what is one of the more high profile races on the Irish cyclocross calendar.

All that was left was to take to the amazing podium and stand on the step which the next day would see Lucinda Brand and Pim Ronhaar take the win.
