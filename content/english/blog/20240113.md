What a venue, what a course.  Thank you [Greenmount Cycling Academy](https://www.greenmountca.com) for treating us to a spectacular weekend.  It was a privilege to get to race in Limerick on Saturday and watch the amazing talent on display all weekend.

Naturally, I was firstly focused on my own race on Saturday.  As I watched the girls I would race against practice the course I realised that I’m fortunate enough to be in a category with a lot of talented riders.  I set about focusing on my own performance and letting the result look after itself.

Blinkers on, I set about my pre-race routine.  My routine before a race has not changed for quite a while but I have been experimenting with ways to reduce being distracted by all the hustle and bustle going on around a race event.  There is a lot going on and I’m glad to have my parents to take care of so many of the details so I can focus on the race ahead.

Gridding done, our race (u14 girls) was lined up behind the u16 girls race.  The running order was to be u16 girls, 60 seconds delay, then u14 girls.  When you are gridded behind another race like this there is a lot to think about.  First I need to get my start right, then I need to focus on my positioning, line, race rhythm etc. within my own race while also thinking about when and where I might catch the back of the u16 race.

I’m really grateful that in our local, provincial and national races riders are very courteous, giving way if we catch the race ahead.  We might also get the occasional shout of encouragement which is the ultimate show of support.

I didn’t get the start I planned for but quickly moved to the front and set the pace for the first half of the lap.  The first part of the lap included a short section of sand, 3 tricky off-camber sections and a much longer sand section.  I was first into each of those sections which allowed me to ride them as I wanted.

There was lots of encouragement for the riders and I could hear my name being called along the course.  I appreciate all of that support and it means a lot to me.  Luke Potter was my pit man for the day (thanks Luke!) which allowed my parents to support me from the sidelines rather than being in the pit.

As I cross the line for the first lap I was 45 seconds up on second place.  It's a gap that can quickly disappear so I knew I had to stay focused.  I was also making my way through the u16 field.  First lap completed I now knew that (1) I had a gap, (2) the field had thinned out so passing would be easier and (3) the race distance would be 3 laps.

Second lap I focused on consistency.  Keep doing the things that work.  The weather was cold and dry which meant the u16/u14 girls are not going to cut up the course so the lines would change little.  I didn’t need to take any risks so I ran a little more of the off-camber section.  Crossing the line the second time had extended my lead a little further.  One more lap!

Even though I was in a comfortable position there is always the risk of getting distracted.  I set about focusing on the wheels ahead.  I crossed the line happy and exhausted…but mostly happy.
