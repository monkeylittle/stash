  title: "About Me"
  description: "Involved in competitive cycling since age 8, I have been diligently developing as an athlete through a multi- disciplined and multi-sport approach. I balance my commitment to sporting achievement with a similar focus on academic achievement."
  content: "I have been deliberate in pursuing a broad cycling programme to help me gain experience, improve skills and develop race craft. While I have achieved memorable results I am focused on the process. Though based in Ireland, through the summer of 2023 and 2024 I lived in Belgium / Netherlands to gain exposure to a higher standard of individual racing. For 2025, my focus is on building experience racing for and toward team goals."

  In 2025, I will continue to pursue my goals riding for Orwell Wheelers domestically while riding in the colours of WOOP Girls in Europe.


  I'm very excited about my race programme in 2025 which will see me race in Ireland, Denmark, Belgium, UK and the Netherlands.

  content: "While there have been many inspiring role models who have paved the way for women in cycling we are still a minority in a niche sport.  Combined with living outside the cycling heartlands means that I am grateful for all the support I receive. This support allows me to gain valuable experience that would otherwise be unattainable.  If you are passionate about supporting young women in sport, reach out to discuss how we might work together."
